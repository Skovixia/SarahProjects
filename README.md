<h1>Hi, I'm Sarah!</h1>
    Here are just some projects I have completed throughout my CS classes. I am attempting to create a small portfolio and engage in more projects to add to it. 
    I would like to become more and more confident in my skill sets and feel that I can take any challenge that comes my way.
